# Bootstrap 5 - Coffee Party

## A first prototype for a company page

You have been tasked by an innovative young company whose core process is to deliver coffee and coffee machines to other companies. They also organize a very popular coffee party event that both individuals and companies can book. At the coffee party, a variety of different coffees are presented for tasting along with dark chocolate, and participants are given the opportunity to purchase the products.

### You should create a website with three pages: “Index”, “Products” and “About Us”

#### For all pages (3 pages):
- A suitable and consistent color theme
- Header; with logo or company name (or both).
- Navbar; with links to all pages
- Footer; with copyright date and webmaster

### Index:
- Divided into four sections

  - Who are we?
  - What do we do?
  - Why us?
  - Coffee party, how does it work?

- These divs should contain filler texts ([Lorem ipsum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum)) and images. A quick Google search will provide good images for a prototype.

### Products:
- Separate Coffee Party and Coffee Machines.
- List coffee machines, different models with texts and images.
- The layout should be divided into two parts.

  - Coffee Machines
    - List coffee machines in a grid
    - Information, model, and price clearly visible

  - Coffee Party
    - Divided into two parts: Companies and Individuals

### About Us/Contact:
- Contains more information about the company.
- Contact details with photo, phone number, name, and email for the CEO
- Contact details with photo, phone number, name, and email for the HR manager

The page should work equally well on mobile as on a regular computer.
This exercise is deliberately left quite open and is intended as an opportunity to experiment a little and test different parts of bootstrap.

Good luck!
